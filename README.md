# Abstract: Inital Thoughts and Project Overview

Under considerable time pressure due to the project duration being 2 days, my partner and I had to quickly find an API online that could provide the nessessary data for us to create a usable product.

After scouring through websites with lists of APIs, some of which were working but alot were not - we discovered TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

TMDB had extensive documentation which helped us a lot when figuring out how to the database is organised and how we can access the necessary parts to create a working product.
